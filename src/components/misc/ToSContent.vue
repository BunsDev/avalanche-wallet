            The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Dispute

            you and us or, if you and we are unable to or fail to agree on the selection of the
            arbitrator within 15 days of the demand for arbitration being served, who is appointed
            by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (JAMS) in accordance with its rules. The
            arbitration will be administered by JAMS pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration
            Rules and Procedures (and in accordance with the expedited procedures in those rules)
            (the “JAMS Rules”), except as modified by this Dispute Resolution section. In the event

            which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive
            relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief
            warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. The JAMS Rules and instructions for how to

            The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Dispute

            you and us or, if you and we are unable to or fail to agree on the selection of the

            the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (and in accordance with the
            expedited procedures in those rules) (the “JAMS Rules”), except as modified by this
            Dispute Resolution section. In the event of a conflict between the JAMS Rules and this
            Dispute Resolution section, this Dispute Resolution section shall control, subject to
            countervailing law, unless the Parties agree otherwise. The arbitrator’s award of
            damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitations of Liability” section
            below as to the types and amounts of damages for which a Party may be held liable. The
            arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and
            only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual
            claim. The JAMS Rules and instructions for how to initiate an arbitration are available

            Unless you and we otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where

            accordance with countervailing law if contrary to the JAMS Rules. However, if the value
            of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, we will pay all filing,
            administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration, unless the

            frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth
            in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). In such circumstances, fees will be
            determined in accordance with the JAMS Rules. Each party shall bear the expense of its
            own attorneys&#39; fees, except as otherwise provided by law. If a statute gives you the
            right to recover any of these fees, these statutory rights shall apply in the
